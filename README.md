# zsh-git-scripts

## Work in progress

A zsh plugin I made to simplify some git calls I use

Install like other custom Oh-My-Zsh plugins.

* `git-squash-branch <name of branch created from>` - includes auto complete support for git branch names
* `git-remove-merged` asks questions to ensure you delete the right branches
